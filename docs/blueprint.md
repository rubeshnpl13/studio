## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to represent reliability, intelligence, and formality suitable for language learning.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a very desaturated version of the primary color, for a calm, focused learning environment.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), an analogous color to the primary blue but significantly different in saturation, to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, clean, and readable text, suitable for all interface elements.
- Use clean and minimalist icons related to language learning concepts, such as speech bubbles, pencils, and flags.
- Design a clean, mobile-optimized chat interface with clear message bubbles, intuitive controls, and easy access to language level settings.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback during voice transcription and error correction processes, enhancing user engagement without being distracting.
